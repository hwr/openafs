20050524: (by Peter Somogyi somogyi@de.ibm.com)
	- bugfix: ACL.c: syscall => pioctl (problem on ppc64)
	- bugfix: ACL.c: memory leak
	- some minor changes in ACL.c to be more accordance to src/venus/fs.c
	- bugfix: inet_ntoa crashed; implemented an own function is Server.c instead
	- modified src/libuafs/MakefileProto.LINUX: added -fPIC flag (doesn't tolerate mixing with non-fPIC on ppc)
	
20050525: (somogyi@de.ibm.com)
	- removed non-error message from getACL; extended the error report (path string) instead of it

20050602: (somogyi@de.ibm.com)
	- moved ACL.c from libjafs.so into libjafsadm.so
	(solves pioctl call failure in [get|set]ACL)
	In the future each one should be in libjafsadm.so - using _only_ AFS API (!!!).
20050603:
	- moved GetNativeString from libjafs.so into libjafsadm.so
20050610:
	- created an automatic testAFS comprehensive java test
	- modified java library: made all getInfo-like methods public
20050614:
	- bugfix: Cell.c: ..._getServersNextString: return "not_implemented" instead of making a crash
20050616:
	- created a multithreaded test; pioctl in getACL fails on i386_linux26, but doesn't fail under ppc64_linux26
20050617:
	- [#]ifdef-separated c sources and makefiles for ppc64_linux26
	- bugfix: eliminating thread-safety crashes on pioctl/i386, but only pioctl works on ppc64 (idef-ed)
	(pioctl didn't crash on ppc64)
20050720:
	- added s390x support, needs some special patches to openafs src
	- added 64-bit support, affects java part
	- refined testAFS.java tester tool

20050727:
	- tested on ppc64/32, fixed some bugs because of some s390x modifications

20050830:
	- modified Makefile.in to support OpenAFS version 1.3.85 or higher (added util/rxkstats.o to libjafs.so)

20050906:
	- added version info (overwritting an earlier implementation)
	- added build info (using AFS_component_version_number.c) which is autogenerated
