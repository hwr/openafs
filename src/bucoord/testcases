Suggested test case for the backup system

1)
	Set variabel sizes on a batch of tapes to be used. Read
	labels on them to verify the name and sizes.

	Dump a large enough volume set so that some volumes
	fragment across tapes and more than one tape is used.

	Do restore of volume dumped in the beginning, at the
	end and inbetween on the tape.

	Enumerate the tapes used to check the volumes on them
	and to determine info for previous step.

	Repeat the above with incrementals as well ie do above
	steps and repeat them doing incremental dumps of the same
	volume set. Then do a full restore on those volumes.

2)
	Do the mix suggested in 1) but introduce variable delays
	in changing tapes and aborting jobs in differing stages
	of dump and restore.

	Also try putting in the wrong tapes.

3) 	
	Do a restore after zapping a volume but keeping the vldb
	entry, but without the .ext flag.
	
4)	To test the diskrestore command. Create some test volumes
	on the selected partition. Dump these volume on tape
	(which creates the db entry as a side effect). Zap these
	volumes using vos zap. issue the diskrestore command with .ext 
	switch.
