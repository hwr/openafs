fms - file mark size evaluation

Fms takes a single argument, the tape device to be used.
To use fms:
 	1) place a scratch tape in the selected tape drive
	2) fms <tape special file>
	   e.g.
	   fms /dev/rmt0

Fms provides a visual trace of its activity. It runs for quite some time,
possibly in excess of 6 hours on 8mm tape drives. Upon termination, a
brief summary of results will be found in the log file, fms.log, which
is created in the current directory.

The tape size and file mark sizes should be adjusted before being used in the
backup system's configuration files. The tape size should be reduced, to 
provide a safety margin (e.g. 10-15% reduction), and the file mark size
should be rounded up or increased.
