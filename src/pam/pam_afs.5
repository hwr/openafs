.SH NAME
pam_afs, pam_afs.so \- pluggable authentication modules for OpenAFS

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam_afs.so.1, pam_afs.krb.so.1

.SH DESCRIPTION
The OpenAFS pluggable authentication module provides module support
for authentication, session management, and password management, which
coorespond to the auth, session, and  password directives in a PAM 
configuration file, respectively.

The
.B pam_afs.krb.so
module additionally keeps users' Kerberos 4 TGT available for users
to use in other applications.  The 
.B pam_afs.so
module does not do this.

The
.B pam_afs.krb.so
module has nothing to do with Kerberos 5 authentication.  Users
with a Kerberos 5 integrated AFS environment should not use
either of these modules, but instead use
.B pam_krb5.so
directly.

.SH OPTIONS
The following arguments are supported.  In parenthesis next to
each option are the environments in which it works.

.IP "cell cell_name"
(auth) Specify a 
.I cell_name 
to authenticate to other than the local cell.
.IP debug
(all) Provide extra debugging information to syslog.
.IP dont_fork
(auth) Do not use a fork() when authenticating.  Forking is a good idea,
because sockets and memory used by the authentication function get
cleaned up automatically.  This option should only be used if a
PAM application fails when a fork() is issued.  This option cannot 
be used with 
.B use_klog.
.IP ignore_root
(auth, password) If user root is authenticating, simply return PAM_SUCCESS without
any AFS authentication attempt.  Presumably, authentication would fall through
to a secondary mechanism.
.IP "ignore_uid uid"
(auth) Similar to ignore_root but it allows you to specify a 
.I uid
such that any user authenticating with uid less than or equal to
.I uid
will not have AFS authentication performed.
.IP no_unlog
(session) Does not destroy a token during logout.  This is useful if
users have background jobs still running under their PAG that
need access to AFS after they log out.
.IP nowarn
(auth, password) Prevents warning from being written to syslog.
.IP refresh_token
(auth) Obtains a token without first obtaining a PAG.  This is useful for
screensavers to update the lifetime of a user's token.
.IP remain
(session) Causes AFS tokens to remain for 5 minutes after logout.
.IP "remainlifetime lifetime"
(session) Specify, in seconds, how long tokens should remain after
logout.
.IP set_token
(auth) If set_token is specified, the token obtained in the authentication
phase is not destroyed.  Ordinarily, tokens are obtained in the
setcred() phase of authentication.  For PAM applications which do not
call setcred(), the
.B set_token
directive should be used.
.IP setenv_password_expires
(auth) Sets the PASSWORD_EXPIRES environment variable to the time when your
AFS token will expire.
.IP try_first_pass
(auth, password) This will first try a password entered to a previous module and if it
fails, prompt for the user's AFS password.
If
.B pam_afs.so
is the first module called, it will generate a failed login attempt
with a NULL password for every user logging in.
.IP use_first_pass
(auth, password) This option is similar to
.B try_first_pass
except that it will not prompt for the user's AFS password if the first
password fails.  If this option is specified and 
.B pam_afs.so
is the first module listed in the PAM configuration, authentication
will fail.
.IP use_klog
(auth) This directs
.B pam_afs.so
to exec klog for authentication instead of calling the authentication
functions in the AFS libraries directly.
