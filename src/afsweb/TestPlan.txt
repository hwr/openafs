A very basic document describing some test ideas for AFS Web Secure (Apache)

1. HTTP tests

	Ensure corect return codes (as per HTTP standards) are being reported for all methods (GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, etc.).

2. Authentication tests
	
	Ensure ACL's and return codes match. ie. ensure that if the AFS acl
permits access then the return code from the web server reflcts it and vice 
versa.

3. Cache consistency tests

	Ensure that the token caches are updated and expiration times checked
and expired tokens purged.

4. PAG tests

	Ensure that each child process for the Apache Server has it's own PAG
and authentication credentials for PAG's do not get mixed up.

5. CGI tests

	Ensure that AFS acls permit or forbid CGI scripts executing.

6. Locking

	Apache child processes use a shared pipe (synchromized by file locking)
for inter process communication with the weblog process. This test would 
ensure that this communication is indeed synchronized and the request for 
an AFS token from one child process does indeed allow the token to be returned
to that same child process with a unique PAG.

7. Performance testing

	Memory leaks, speed.


8. Propogate changes (release) from a read-write colume to read-only volumes 
and ensure the web server gives consistent file updates.
