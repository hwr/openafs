openafs (@DEB_PKGVER@-1~openafs) unstable; urgency=low

  * Local package built from OpenAFS source.
  * This Debian package was generated using the packaging files included
    in the OpenAFS release, provided as a convenience for users who would
    like to quickly build Debian packages based on the current OpenAFS
    code.  For production use, the packages included in Debian and Ubuntu
    should normally be used instead.  The version of this package is set
    so that it will be automatically upgraded to the official Debian or
    Ubuntu versions when packages for at least this version of OpenAFS are
    available.

openafs (1.5.77-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [ca2a7363] libuafs: Don't #define user (fixes armel build)
    - [f7f366d0] Link dafssync-debug(8) to fssync-debug(8)
    - [a2cf6b8d] Fix POD errors in fileserver and dasalvager
    - [e36b4e00] Update bos create man page for new demand-attach
  * Add backslashes to the DKMS command, which will be required once DKMS
    uses proper shell quoting.
  * In openafs-modules-source, use /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build as the
    default path to the kernel headers rather than /usr/src/linux.
    Current kernel header packages will create an appropriate symlink
    there.  This default is only used when neither module-assistant nor
    kernel-package are used.
  * In the openafs-client init script, stop looking for openafs.o; Debian
    hasn't supported 2.4 kernels for quite some time.  Remove all the $MP
    handling since we force a module name of openafs.ko using
    --with-linux-kernel-packaging.

openafs (1.5.77-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [7594331c] Add NEWS entries for OpenAFS 1.5.77 and 1.5.76
  * New upstream testing release.
    - Demand-attach servers are now always built and installed under
      separate names (dafileserver, davolserver, dasalvager).  This means
      that the default names are no longer demand-attach, which means that
      upgrades from previous experimental versions will fail (but upgrades
      from non-experimental versions will be much cleaner).
    - Linux 2.6.36 support and improved freezer interface support.
    - More robust path MTU detection.
    - Return VNOVOL from fileserver when a volume is deleted.
    - Improve handling of some corruption in the salvager.
    - Relax too-strict checks in ptserver on foreign names.
    - Better reporting of failures during volume attach.
    - Better fileserver handling of host hash collisions.
    - Fix statistics reporting in RXAFS_GetStatistics64.
    - Improved disconnected mode reference tracking.
    - Avoid a kernel panic during vcache contention.
    - Fix potential kernel panic during bulkstatus.
    - Better vos dry-run mode for syncvldb and syncserv.
    - Fix s390x kernel build support.
  * Update afs-newcell and README.servers to recommend using the
    demand-attach fileserver binaries and dafs bos type.
  * Force disabling of Linux syscall probing in kernel module builds.
  * Remove obsolete --enable-demand-attach-fs and --enable-disconnected
    configure flags.  These are now unconditional upstream.
  * The openafs-fileserver init script now depends on $named since
    apparently the volserver requires DNS during startup.  Thanks, Jaap
    Winius.  (Closes: #589783)
  * Use dpkg --print-architecture, not --print-installation-architecture,
    in the openafs-fileserver config script.  The latter is deprecated.
    Thanks, Peter Palfrader.  (Closes: #594488)
  * Add a dependency on libc6-dev to openafs-modules-dkms.  dkms doesn't
    depend on it because most kernel modules don't need it, but openafs
    builds userspace helper programs.  Thanks, Peter Palfrader.
  * Fix the sample CellServDB entry printed by afs-newcell if the cell
    isn't found in /etc/openafs/CellServDB to include the correct server
    syntax.  Thanks, Peter Palfrader.
  * Run the DKMS build commands in a subshell to work around a DKMS bug
    that caused the module build logs to be discarded.  (LP: #593509)
  * Add a status command to the openafs-fileserver init script.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
    - Rewrite debian/rules to use dh and overrides.
    - Use dh_installdocs --link-doc to handle linked doc directories.
    - Rewrite debian/module/rules to use dh and overrides.
    - Bump -source package dependency and compat to debhelper 8.
  * Add ${perl:Depends} to openafs-modules-dkms and perl to the
    dependencies of openafs-modules-source, since Perl is used as part of
    the module build system now.
  * Remove bison and flex dependencies for the module build packages.  We
    now ship the results of rxgen, so don't need all the tools required to
    build the full source tree.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

openafs (1.5.75-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [57d727da] Link libafsauthent with -lresolv if required
    - [c3fc948e] Check for crypt in external library
    - [a1351d48] Fix ktime test on 64-bit systems
  * Use --after instead of --remaining in binary-indep to avoid running
    dh_auto_install and doing the installation process again.

openafs (1.5.75-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream testing release.
    - Path MTU discovery for networks with bad fragmentation.
    - New -human flag for human-readable units in some fs commands.
    - Provide reasons for locked volumes in vos when known.
    - Improvements to Rx ping and NAT handling.
    - Improvements to the userspace AFS client.
    - Substantial updates to the Administrator's Guide.
    - Various bug fixes and improvements to the file server.
    - Force core file generation in bosserver.
    - Improve vlclient and vldb_check.
    - Avoid volume corruption on creation if files were left over from a
      previous failed cleanup.
    - Do not tie up fileserver threads with volumes being taken offline.
    - Break origin's callback on the target of a rename operation.
    - Do not open /dev/console in the fileserver.  (Closes: #582111)
    - Avoid unneeded sync() calls in the fileserver.
    - Update client disk cache version.
    - Parallelization improvements in lock management in the client.
    - New -dynroot-sparse mode for afsd to not show all cells in the
      CellServDB until that cell is needed.
    - Fix aklog crash with linked cell handling.
    - Fix fs getserverprefs -vlservers with default CellServDB list.
    - Report server address when logging warnings.
    - Avoid panic in GetCapabilities with an unknown cell.
    - Report process name and ID for advisory lock warnings when
      possible.
    - Flush pending changes to server when releasing file locks.
    - Various other client bug fixes on error handling and callbacks.
    - Disable syscall probes when keyrings are supported.
    - Use filehandles for all Linux 2.6 versions to avoid
      incompatibilities with mismatched afsds.
    - Update Linux kernel support for 2.6.35.
    - The stripped source tree generated for kernel module builds is now
      truly architecture-independent and can build on i386 for amd64
      kernels (for example).  (Closes: #518270)
    - Fix build problems on alpha.
  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [bbce0515] Add NEWS entries for 1.5.75
    - [c790e7d0] Remove a few erroneous NEWS entries for 1.5.75
    - [9e2aba99] Fix ktime test for errors
    - [5cc6293c] Provide man pages for more fssync-debug commands
  * Set the OpenAFS build version to the Debian package version with
    -debian appended so that the Debian package versions can be
    distinguished from unmodified upstream versions.
  * Build shared library packages for libafsauthent and libafsrpc.
    Upstream is now more careful about the ABI.  (Closes: #433054)
  * Explicitly link libafsauthent with -lresolv -lcrypt.  This is a
    temporary fix for Linux that will be replaced by a better upstream fix
    in the next release.
  * openafs-modules-source and openafs-modules-dkms are now architecture:
    all.  The generated kernel source is now architecture-independent.
  * openafs-modules-source and openafs-modules-dkms now recommend an
    appropriate version of openafs-client.
  * Update kernel module packaging scripts:
    - Remove selection of linux-image vs. kernel-image for kernel names.
    - Use Breaks instead of Conflicts.
    - Update standards version to 3.9.0.
  * Tighten the dependencies on openafs-client in packages that symlink
    their /usr/share/doc directories to openafs-client's to meet the
    Policy requirements for changelog files.
  * Remove the lpia architecture.  This was an experiment in Ubuntu that
    has apparently been dropped.
  * Add preliminary support for powerpcspe, mapping that architecture to
    ppc_linux26.  The kernel build won't work unless uname -m on that
    architecture returns ppc.
  * Minor update to README.Debian for openafs-doc: the old IBM release
    notes are no longer included.
  * Remove conflicts/replaces/provides for openafs-ptutil, which was
    ancient (removed in 2001).
  * Install an upstream changelog file now that upstream provides one.
  * Add a workaround in the clean target to allow the same packaging files
    to be used by upstream, which removes changelog during distclean
    because it's Autoconf-generated.  This workaround will not trigger
    during a normal Debian package build.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.0.
    - Use Breaks instead of Conflicts where appropriate.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Jul 2010 14:46:10 -0700

openafs (1.5.74.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream testing release.
    - Correctly recognize cache version differences in upgrades from 1.4
      and invalidate the old cache.
    - Resolve symlinks in fs rmmount.
    - Include PID in byte-range lock warning.
  * Preserve the AFS mount point and cache directories set in
    /etc/openafs/cacheinfo if the file already exists rather than
    overwriting them with the defaults.  Thanks, Liam Healy.
    (Closes: #580077)
  * In the openafs-client init script, don't assume that AFS is mounted on
    /afs when unmounting it or killing processes with AFS files open.
    Instead, parse /etc/mtab to find the AFS mount point.
  * Move the experimental afsd.fuse AFS FUSE client into openafs-fuse to
    avoid adding a FUSE dependency in openafs-client.  Document its
    current limitations in the package description.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 04 May 2010 21:49:52 -0700

openafs (1.5.74-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [e6f6c349] Fixes and clarifications to vos setaddrs man page
    - [d80382ef] Remove special-case call for KAM_SetPassword on s390
  * Fix ucontext detection on ppc_linux26, hopefully fixing build failures
    on the Debian powerpc architecture.
  * Install afsd.fuse and a man page link for it if the FUSE client build
    is enabled.
  * Add build dependency on libfuse-dev and pass --enable-fuse-client to
    configure so that the new FUSE afsd is built.  Install afsd.fuse into
    the openafs-client package for the time being; it will move to some
    other package before being uploaded to unstable so that openafs-client
    doesn't keep a dependency on libfuse.  There is, as yet, no
    documentation or init script support for the FUSE implementation.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Apr 2010 18:12:06 -0700

openafs (1.5.74-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream testing release.
    - New vos setaddrs command.
    - Significant improvements to libuafs (user-space AFS client).
    - Initial FUSE implementation for afsd.
    - pts mem -supergroup and -expandgroups options.
    - Rx lock acquisition and thread safety fixes.
    - Fileserver capabilities support for the UNIX client.
    - Various afsmonitor improvements.

openafs (1.5.73.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream testing release.
    - New demand-attach file server support for greatly improved file
      server restart times.
    - Support for split readonly/read-write client caches.
    - Better client handling of file server meltdowns.
    - Experimental read-only client disconnected mode.
    - NFS translator clients now work properly on Linux.
    - Client cache readahead.
    - Network performance improvements.
    - New libkopenafs library providing a kernel PAG manipulation
      interface (a subset of the API provided by Heimdal's libkafs).
    - Fix builds on sparc64.  (LP: #181661)
  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [7d395f17] Improve demand-attach fileserver bos documentation
    - [a763edc3] Make src/rx/rx.c not executable
    - [8d41bc24] Reallocate memory in aklog for the AFS ID string
    - [be449999] Fix typo in bos_create manpage
    - [fdb9429e] Linux: kmap() not page_address()
  * Build OpenAFS with demand-attach enabled for the file server, bos
    restricted mode enabled for bosserver, and disconnected mode enabled
    for the client.  Except for demand-attach, these options don't change
    the default behavior, just make new capabilities available.
  * The openafs-modules package now provides openafs-modules3 and
    conflicts on pre-1.5.61 openafs-client packages since the interface
    between afsd and the module has changed.  openafs-client now conflicts
    with openafs-modules2 and recommends openafs-modules3.
  * Change the default permissions of /etc/openafs/server to 0755 to match
    upstream defaults, but do not change permissions on upgrade.  The only
    file in that directory that needs to be protected is KeyFile, which
    should be mode 0600 anyway.  Drop the patch to bosserver to allow more
    restrictive permissions.  bosserver will complain about directory
    permissions after upgrade until the directory is manually changed.
  * Upstream now installs afszcm.cat and finds it in /usr/share/openafs/C,
    so use the version installed via make install and install it in the
    same location.
  * Upstream builds specific files with -fno-strict-aliasing where needed,
    so we no longer need to build the whole source with that flag.
  * Upstream no longer includes files covered by the Apple Public Source
    License, so we no longer have to repackage the upstream source to
    remove those files.  Drop Debian patches to the build system that were
    compensating for the removal of those files.
  * Switch to generating upstream tarballs from the upstream Git tag
    rather than from tarball releases.  There's no reason to include all
    the generated files when we're going to regenerate them anyway, and
    this saves effort combining the doc and src tarballs.

    - [190ef2cb] volmonitor keep vtrans lock
    - [812dcc2c] Increase the maximum number of sysnames
    - [a123d4ab] Print rxdebug statistics as unsigned values
  * If the user configures openafs-client to use AFSDB records for VLDB
    server location, don't prompt the user for VLDB servers for the local
    cell even if they're not present in CellServDB and don't try to add an
    entry for the local cell to CellServDB.  (Closes: #575299)

    - [0583af32] volmonitor copy link before calling free
    - [eb799d07] Move non-executable stack assembly code to end of file
  * Build with -fno-strict-aliasing.  The upstream development branch has
    a better fix that selectively enables this for specific files with
    known problems, but be conservative for the stable release.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Mar 2010 15:53:48 -0700

openafs (1.4.12+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Enable weak encryption types in aklog and klog.krb5.
    - Build support for Linux 2.6.33.
    - Improvements to host tracking safety in the file server.
    - Fall back to current kernel credentials if we can't use stored ones.
    - Fix truncation handling in some large file situations.
    - Further fixes to mmap handling.
    - Avoid double-free in some FetchData64 error situations.
    - Stop warning about system call hooks when keyrings are in use.
    - Flush vcaches when a mount fails to avoid inconsistent data.
    - New dump tag and length standard for vos dump.
    - Fix stack executability for programs containing assembly code.
    - Various salvager robustness fixes.
  * Use dh_dkms from the DKMS package to handle creation of the maintainer
    scripts for openafs-modules-dkms rather than rolling our own.
    (LP: #497149)
  * Update init script to require $remote_fs be started first and stopped
    after OpenAFS.  This won't be the case in the long run, but for now
    some important boot-time options need /usr/bin/fs to set them.
  * List $syslog in Should-Start for the openafs-client init script, since
    otherwise if loading the module causes a kernel panic, it won't be
    logged to disk.
  * Update CellServDB to the 2010-02-28 version.
  * Add README.source explaining maintenance procedures and a
    debian/import-upstream script to do a Git-aware merge of a new
    upstream release that will allow us to cherry-pick upstream patches
    and do proper merges.
  * Stop linking the openafs-fileserver doc directory to openafs-client so
    that we can provide a separate NEWS.Debian.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).

    - [7183c113] Do not check *aoutSize in PGetPAG

    - [70f6a328] Check for (hostFlags & HOSTDELETED) after h_Lock_r
    - [c7a59397] Avoid IHandle leak when failing to attach volume
  * Remove incorrect return call in shutdown_icl() introduced by b7198421.
  * Do not attempt to build the kernel module with DKMS if the appropriate
    Linux headers aren't installed.  Based on code from the common DKMS
    postinst script (which we'll just use once it's reliably available).
    Thanks, Anders Kaseorg.  (LP: #487535)
  * Fix configure flags used for enabling or disabling LWP and kernel
    debugging flags and always pass --disable-strip-binaries.
  * Fix the openafs-dbg dependencies and package description to reflect
    its inclusion of debugging symbols for all server binaries in
    openafs-fileserver and openafs-dbserver, but not the legacy PAM
    modules.
  * In anticipation of a change in dpkg-source's defaults, force source
    package format 1.0.  The package is maintained using Git and
    generating a proper quilt series is complex and relatively pointless
    work, so the additional complexity of the 3.0 format is currently not
    that useful.
  * Change section of openafs-modules-dkms to kernel to match override.

openafs (1.4.11+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - openafs-stable-1_4_x/fileserver-no-negative-fetchdata-20090926:
      never return a negative data length from client reads past the end
      of a file.
    - openafs-stable-1_4_x/fileserver-gethost-r-cleanup-fixes-20090925:
      fix memory leak and possible double-free in error handling cases in
      fileserver.
    - openafs-stable-1_4_x/fileserver-retry-registeraddrs-20090810: retry
      VL_RegisterAddrs in the file server on failure.
    - openafs-stable-1_4_x/kernel-init-vrequest-structure-20090914:
      properly initialize vrequest structure in the kernel.
  * Change the permissions of /var/lib/openafs/local to 0700 to match
    upstream defaults.  This directory contains the fssync.sock file used
    for coordination between the fileserver and the volserver, and
    commands sent to that socket are not authenticated.  Linux protects
    the socket from unprivileged writes by default, but other operating
    systems do not.  Upstream therefore wants this directory to be 0700
    and bosserver will complain by default if it's not.  Changing the
    permissions let us drop a patch to bosserver.
  * Fix the second module control file for the standards version, section,
    and maintainer update.
  * Change the source package name of the stripped package generated by
    openafs-modules-source so that, should someone build a Debian source
    package from it, it won't have the same name as the main openafs
    source package.

  * Ignore failures to remove an existing DKMS tree in the prerm of the

    make sense.  (Further addresses LP #368471.)
  * Don't install man pages for fs command variants that are only
    available on Windows.
  * Bring src/config/linux-version closer to upstream since upstream now
    handles unversioned source directories.  There is one remaining change
    required to search for UTS_RELEASE in the correct header path.
  * Update CellServDB to 2009-06-29 version.

  * Apply upstream CVS deltas:
    - STABLE14-dprintf-rename-20090427: rename AFS's dprintf to avoid
      conflicts with one in the kernel.
    - STABLE14-linux26-defer-cred-changing-20090511: defer changing groups
      when the real and effective credentials of a process differ to avoid
      running afoul of checks in newer Linux kernels that cause oops.
      (Closes: #528785)
    - STABLE14-linux-mmap-antirecursion-fix-20090512 and
      STABLE14-linux-mmap-antirecursion-avoid-spurious-eio-20090526:
      improvements in flag setting and locking around recursive mmap
      protection.
    - STABLE14-memcache-write-on-laststore-20090512: write back dirty
      pages on last store with memcache to avoid losing changes.
    - STABLE14-background-fsync-consistency-issues-20090522: file
      descriptor handling fixes for the file server.

      -omitdirs flags to vos dump.  (Closes: #502571)
  * Provide an openafs-modules-dkms package that uses DKMS to dynamically
    build kernel modules for the local kernel and document this option in
    README.modules.  This is an alternative to installing
    openafs-modules-source and building kernel modules for each new kernel
    with module-assistant or make-kpkg.  (Closes: #168852, #525131)

  * Have openafs-client recommend at least the current source version of
    openafs-modules-source or openafs-modules-dkms instead of any old
    version.  While the API probably hasn't changed, it's best practice to
    keep a relatively close match between the userspace andn the kernel

openafs (1.4.10+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    - OPENAFS-SA-2009-001: Avoid a potential kernel memory overrun if more
      items than requested are returned from an InlineBulk or BulkStatus
      message.  (CVE-2009-1251)
    - OPENAFS-SA-2009-002: Avoid converting negative errors into invalid
      kernel memory pointers.  (CVE-2009-1250)
    - Preliminary support for 2.6.30 kernels.
    - Dynamic vcache allocation support to deal with inotify vcache
      pinning.
    - Do appropriate locking for CellServDB in /proc.
    - Use +dfsg instead of .dfsg for saner version sorting.
  * Debian's 2.6.29 packages no longer include symlinks from the
    architecture-specific header tree to the common header tree and
    instead overlay both header trees using kbuild.  Change the Autoconf
    probes to always use kbuild and generate stub headers in the paths
    that OpenAFS expects that include the linux headers.  Patch from Aaron
    M. Ucko.  (Closes: #521745)
  * Build PIC versions of libafsauthent and libafsrpc and install them in
    libopenafs-dev for use when AFS code should be embedded into shared
    libraries.  Patch from Garrett Wollman.
  * Update CellServDB to 2008-11-07 version.  (Closes: #522451)

openafs (1.4.8.dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make openafs-modules-source architecture-specific (arch: any instead
    of arch: all).  The new method for generating the kernel source tree
    only generates correct build machinery for the architecture on which
    it was built, making the package architecture-specific.  The generated
    tree is so much smaller that this still only uses about 1MB of archive
    space more than the old method and makes each openafs-modules-source
    package much smaller.  This is a workaround until we can fix
    libafs_tree to include enough build machinery to handle all Linux
    architectures from one source tree.  (Closes: #516023)
  * Explicitly remove *-stamp files in the clean target of the module
    build until the module build is upgraded to debhelper 7.

    - Check at compile time that the kernel has keyring support rather
      than building non-functional modules.  (Closes: #500850)
    - Include vos clone man page.  (LP: #324449)
  * Apply upstream CVS deltas:
    - STABLE14-libuafs-updates-20081229: prerequisite for other deltas.
    - STABLE14-linux-truncate-race-20090109: avoid race condition during

      (Closes: #513680)
    - STABLE14-rx-idledead-only-ignore-keepalives-20081222: rx bug fix to
      not ignore other ping packets.
    - STABLE14-rx-rdwr-writeproc-race-20081228: fix rx race condition that
      could result in reuse of freed memory.
    - STABLE14-rx-do-not-race-current-packet-20090105: fix rx race
      condition.
  * Use make libafs_tree to generate the tree for the kernel module
    compile rather than copying the entire source tree.
  * Compress the source in openafs-modules-source with bzip2 instead of
    gzip to reduce the package size.
  * Make dynroot the default for new installations.  It works much better
    with systems that don't bring up their network until late in the boot
    process, such as wireless laptops.  (LP: #249240, #318605)
  * Mention libpam-afs-session instead of libpam-openafs-session in the
    description of libpam-openafs-kaserver, and mention libpam-krb5 by
    name.  Thanks, Philipp Kaluza.  (Closes: #501308)
  * Suggest module-assistant auto-install in README.modules and be clearer
    that building one's own kernel is not required.  Thanks, Anders
    Kaseorg and Lutz Goehring for suggestions.  (LP: #295897)
  * Allow time-daemon to satisfy the openafs-fileserver recommends in
    addition to ntp, allowing for openntpd.  (Closes: #508258)
  * General improvements to debconf configuration handling.
    - Do not abort the config script if we have no default realm and
      dnsdomainname fails.  (LP: #274886, #318132)
    - Do not abort postinst if we can't resolve any host name for the
      cell.  Just continue in that case, omitting any configuration for
      the local cell.  (LP: #322054)
    - Correctly set the default for AFS_CRYPT from the existing config.
    - The cache size is high, not critical, since we have a default.
    - Don't create the client ThisCell if no local cell was specified.
    - Improve the leading comment in afs.conf.client.  Users can edit it,
      but any changes other than the setting values will be lost.
    - Remove the openafs-fileserver/bosconfig_moved template, which would
      only be shown on upgrades from pre-1.2.0 versions.
    - Standardize coding style and always quote strings.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V7.
    - Use dh where possible in debian/rules.
    - Use dh_lintian to install Lintian overrides.
    - Eliminate the configure target and do all the work in build.
    - Do more in the install target and less in binary, matching the
      default command stacks in dh.
    - Use a debian/clean configuration file to let dh clean do more of the
      work rather than using rm commands in debian/rules.
  * Abort the config script rather than exiting successfully if the
    debconf shell module is not available.  The config script should never
    be run in the absence of debconf, so if this fails, something deeper
    is wrong and we shouldn't blindly continue.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to all dependencies.
  * Add explanations for the Lintian overrides.
  * Use set -e instead of #!/bin/sh -e in maintainer scripts.
  * Remove server documentation from openafs-modules-source.

    Thanks, Marc Dionne.  (Closes: #493914)
  * Apply upstream deltas to support 2.6.27 kernels and to stop using
    COMMON_KERN_CFLAGS for all 2.6 kernels uniformly, which fixes

    we were building with UCONTEXT which is stubbed out in glibc for hppa,
    and builds without UCONTEXT fail.  The binaries we were building
    before didn't work and no one reported a bug, indicating no one was
    attempting to use OpenAFS on hppa.
  * When building the kernel module, use the setting of the ARCH
    environment or make variable, if present, in preference to uname -m to
    allow cross-compiles.  Thanks, Jose Calhariz.  (Closes: #492232)
  * Add Jason Edgecomb's copyright and license for man pages to

    Thanks, Dominic Hargreaves.  (Closes: #490752)
  * Don't use UCONTEXT on hppa; its glibc doesn't provide those
    functions.  It's possible that OpenAFS isn't working properly on hppa

openafs (1.4.7.dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream delta for Linux 2.6.26 support.
  * Enable support for arm and armel, added upstream in 1.4.7.
  * Enable support for lpia by making it synonymous with i386.  This means
    that lpia systems will get a sysname of i386_linux26, which isn't
    ideal but should at least work.
  * When clearing the restart time while installing a new cell, pass
    -localauth to avoid an authentication failure.  Thanks, Davor Ocelic.
    (Closes: #488152)
  * If the openafs module isn't listed in modules.dep, exit with a zero
    status from the init script even if modprobe fails.  Otherwise, if a
    module package and openafs-client are installed at the same time and
    openafs-client is set up before the module package, the init script
    can find the module, fail the modprobe (because the dependency map
    hasn't yet been updated), and fail the whole installation.  Exiting
    with a zero status still doesn't get OpenAFS started, but at least it
    doesn't leave the system in a partly installed state.  Thanks to Durk
    Strooisma for the analysis.  (Closes: #486816)
  * Don't include debug symbols for /sbin, /usr/bin, and /usr/sbin
    binaries or PAM modules in openafs-dbg, just the servers in
    /usr/lib/openafs, since those are the most likely cases where
    backtraces are important and a 10MB debug symbol package seems like
    overkill.
  * Stop using quilt to manage patches and pre-apply them to the source
    package now that the package is maintained with Git.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Reflect current responsibilities more accurately by listing myself as
    maintainer and Sam as uploader.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).
  * Drop unused postinst-uses-db-input override; Lintian has been fixed.

    - Potential deadlock fixed in the fileserver.
    - Better fileserver host tracking.
    - Ubik fixes preventing database truncation on unreliable links.
  * Add upstream delta to fix oops on startup with pre-2.6.25 kernels.
  * Install the up man page as afs-up, matching our renaming, and update
    its text accordingly.  (Closes: #459635)
  * Move openafs-client later in the shutdown sequence on new

  * debian/rules and debian/module/rules improvements:
    - Remove all modified generated files on debian/rules clean.
    - Depend on $(QUILT_STAMPFN) instead of patch.

  * Apply upstream patch from the 1.5 series to allow multiple realms to

  * Build bosserver with --enable-bos-new-config.  On startup, if
    BosConfig.new exists, it will be renamed to BosConfig before the

  * Use uname -m rather than dpkg --print-architecture to determine the
    sysname for kernel module builds.  Otherwise, builds with a different
    kernel architecture than userspace (amd64 kernels with i386 userspace,
    for example) don't work.  Thanks, Anders Kaseorg.  (Closes: #448452)
  * Fix signing the generated the changes file on a kernel module build.
    The module build file reorganization required an additional change to

  * Expose prototypes for the ktc_* functions.  (Closes: #449432)
  * Fix man pages for subcommands to use an underscore in the NAME section

    - Fix errors when compiled with gcc 4.2.  (Closes: #443937)
    - Add a frightening hack to work around the lack of getcontext and
      savecontext for 32-bit SPARc.  (Closes: #415952, #446837)
    - Add support for Linux 2.6.23.
    - Multiple bug fixes for client tracking in the file server.
    - Prevent one client from consuming all file server threads.
  * Remove the workaround added for 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 kernels with
    CONFIG_PARAVIRT enabled.  The mistaken GPL-labelling of core
    interfaces was fixed in 2.6.22, which has now migrated to testing.
  * Scan /var/log/openafs for core files with a PID appended when a server
    run by bosserver exits with a signal.  bosserver was unable to
    correctly handle core files for multithreaded servers since it
    expected a filename of core and Linux always appends a PID to core

  * Trim additional unuseful debug information from openafs-dbg.
  * Restructure the source for the module package.  The build files for

  * Apply upstream patch for the OpenAFS file server to treat clients that
    have an all-zero UUID as if they don't have UUID support, working
    around bugs in various client versions that can cause multiple hosts
    to use all-zero UUIDs and conflict with each other.
  * Use dpkg --print-architecture to determine the AFS sysname for both
    regular builds (avoiding --print-installation-architecture, which is
    deprecated) and kernel builds (avoiding arch, which is temporarily not
    in unstable and which wouldn't do the right thing for cross-compiles).
    Thanks, Chris Hanson.  (Closes: #435765)
  * Add hppa as a recognized architecture for kernel module builds,
    although OpenAFS currently only supports 2.4 kernels on HPPA so this
    isn't that useful.

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch from Jeffrey Hutzelman to fix syscall probing on
    AMD64 with Linux 2.6.22 kernels.  (Closes: #430179)
  * Add a union to des_ks_struct and reorder includes to get the correct
    alignment for DES code on SPARC.  Thanks, Chaskiel Grundman.  Partly
    addresses #415952.
  * Fix a typo in debian/kern-sysname that caused openafs-modules-source
    to still assume all ia64 systems used Linux 2.4.  Thanks, Jakob
    Haufe.  (Closes: #432344)
  * Use LSB logging functions for openafs-fileserver and support passing
    arguments to bosserver in /etc/default/openafs-fileserver by setting
    DAEMON_ARGS.
  * Clean up more completely after a purge of openafs-fileserver.  Remove
    the files created by the server in /var/lib/openafs/local, remove
    KeyFile and CellServDB.old from /etc/openafs/server, and remove
    BosConfig from /etc/openafs.

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch from Jeffrey Hutzelman to fix kernel module
    builds on ppc64.  (Closes: #427555)
  * Apply upstream patches for Linux 2.6.22 support.  (Closes: #428401)
  * Apply upstream patch to fix the AFS /proc structure under Linux
    2.6.22.1 and later.
  * Move /etc/openafs/server-local to /var/lib/openafs/local.  Most of the
    files here are automatically generated and hence not configuration
    files, and the file server has to write to this directory to start (so
    having it in /etc breaks read-only / file systems).  Thanks, Alexei
    Sheplyakov.  (Closes: #405697)
  * Move upserver and upclient to /usr/lib/openafs (from /usr/sbin) to
    match upstream's layout and for consistency with the other servers run
    via bosserver.
  * Use --name instead of --exec in the openafs-fileserver init script and
    drop the --pidfile option (bosserver doesn't create a PID file) so
    that we don't start a second bosserver on upgrades.
  * Go back to using krb5-config.  The dependency problem has now been
    fixed on all platforms in the krb5 package and this is the preferred
    upstream method.

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always generate a UUID on client startup even if for some reason we
    don't think we have any network interfaces.  Otherwise, the client
    will use an all-zeroes UUID, which will collide with every other
    client with the same problem.
  * When afsd is started with -rmtsys, it starts another process that afsd
    -shutdown doesn't kill.  Update the init script to kill this process
    on stop.  (Closes: #405982)
  * Don't use krb5-config to get a library list.  It runs the risk of
    encoding unnecessary library dependencies.  Instead, hard-code the
    flags and libraries we actually need.  (Closes: #424448)
  * When loading a module using the upstream naming convention, don't
    append the .mp to the module name for modprobe.  (Closes: #420597)

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian kernels as of 2.6.20 enable CONFIG_PARAVIRT, which redefines
    several core kernel calls as redirects through a paravirt.ops table
    that's marked GPL-only.  This breaks all non-GPL modules that used
    those (previously generally exported) calls even indirectly.  Apply a
    hack to switch from spin_lock_irq to spin_lock_irqsave to avoid the
    paravirt redirection so that the module will build.
  * Enable ucontext for all Linux builds with glibc 2.4 or later, not just
    with i386 and amd64, and (following an upstream patch) always use
    ucontext on ia64.  Newer versions of glibc change internal structures
    in ways that cause the old LWP code to have stack overflows.
    (Closes: #419903) 
  * Apply upstream patch to crashes on contention in afs_xuser when a
    process in a PAG exits.  Thanks, Chaskiel Grundman.
  * When determining the AFS sysname for kernel module builds, add
    explicit cases for 2.6 kernels for all architectures that support them
    (everything except non-64-bit sparc_linux).  Fixes build problems with
    ia64 and probably other architectures.  Thanks to Ippokratis Pandis
    for the debugging help.  (Closes: #411818)
  * Prefer alpha_linux_26 to alpha_linux_24 for the non-kernel build on
    Alpha, now that the source supports it.
  * Add support for the s390x architecture.  Upstream supports it and
    there's no reason not to.
  * Fix the watch file to remove .dfsg\d+ when comparing versions.

  * Repackage upstream source to remove two additional files covered under
    the APSL.  (Closes: #416685)
  * Build-depend on Automake since we run aclocal during the build.  Not
    having aclocal caused local patches to osconf.m4 to not be effective,
    leading to the wrong compiler flags for shared libraries.  Thanks to
    Frank Lichtenheld for the report.  (Closes: #416398, #416497, #418966)

    - Support newer Linux kernels.  (Closes: #409797, #410120)
    - Add aklog fallbacks for null realms to support the referral
      capability in MIT Kerberos 1.6 and later.  (Closes: #410314)
  * Apply patch from Thomas Sesselmann to support setting options to pass
    to bosserver in /etc/default/openafs-fileserver.  (Closes: #409357)
  * Remove the rx_Init calls in the PAM module.  The internal counters
    that had to be initialized that way have been removed.
  * Now that we're running regen.sh as part of the build process, only
    patch the Autoconf source files and not the generated output to make
    the diff easier to audit.

openafs (1.4.2-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY: Apply upstream patch to disable setuid status on all cells
    by default.  Prior versions of AFS defaulted to honoring setuid bits
    in the local cell, but since unauthenticated file access in AFS is
    unencrypted, an attacker could forge packets from an AFS file server
    to synthesize a setuid binary in AFS.
  * Apply upstream fix to use a single high-numbered group for the PAG on
    2.6 kernels and sort the group properly.  Fixes AFS-caused group
    ordering problems that could lead the kernel to ignore some group
    membership for users.  (Closes: #414911)
  * Apply upstream fix for segfaults in pts rename.  (Closes: #409184)
  * Apply upstream fix to show reasonable free space numbers for AFS in
    df.  Without this fix, some programs which use df to check free space
    may think that directories in AFS are full and prevent the user from
    attempting to write files.  (Closes: #415294)

  * Accept trailing whitespace in ThisCell.
  * Fix path canonicalization on the server, enabling bos getlog with a
    simple log name to work properly against a Debian bosserver.
  * Change the documentation of afsd -shutdown to be less dire and more
    accurate.  Thanks, Daniel J. Priem.  (Closes: #394990)
  * Document (at least partially) AFS's mapping of Kerberos v5 principal
    names to Kerberos v4 format in the aklog man page.  Thanks, Daniel

openafs (1.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include all of AFS's local XDR implementation in the build for
    shlibafsrpc, fixing problems with undefined symbols in the PAM module
    on AMD64.
  * When creating a new file server in afs-newcell, use a set of tuning
    flags from Harald Barth rather than relying on the defaults.  This
    doesn't help with general bos create; long term, the defaults need to
    be fixed.  (Closes: #364100)
  * Add a note in README.servers about fileserver tuning options.
  * Update debconf templates to follow the best practice recommendations
    from the Developer's Reference.
  * Regenerate the man pages on build since the pre-generated ones were
    done with a very old version of pod2man.
  * Update standards version to 3.7.2 (no changes required).
  * Use a better method of optionally running make distclean.
  * Add build-arch and build-indep targets, just in case.

    - Safer cache size calculation.  (Closes: #360176)

  * Subsume openafs-krb5 into this source package.
    - Acknowledge NMU.  (Closes: #304933)
    - Update to the OpenAFS aklog and asetkey.  (Closes: #196094)

    - Include ka-forwarder from the old migration toolkit.
    - Add man pages for asetkey and ka-forwarder.
  * Subsume openafs-doc into this source package.
  * Since 2.6 is the supported kernel for etch, build the userspace with
    a sysname of *_linux26 where supported.  This only affects the sys
    command.  (Using livesys instead is better.)  (Closes: #358118)
  * Always pass the system type into Autoconf, following autotools-dev

openafs (1.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch from Chas Williams to be more careful about what
    dentry is used in renames, avoiding a kernel fault when renaming
    dentries accessed through multiple paths (such as RO and RW).
  * Apply patch to allow the module to build with the Ubuntu kernel.
    Thanks, Björn Torkelsson.  (Closes: #342607)
  * Stop unconditionally forcing the compiler to cc or gcc in configure,
    allowing, among other things, building the kernel module with a
    compiler other than the default system compiler.  (Closes: #338306)
  * Call kernel-version correctly from prep-modules, which fixes build
    issues with manually-built kernels.  (Closes: #344851)
  * Backport man pages from upstream CVS.  (Closes: #79763)
  * Include afsmonitor and livesys in openafs-client.
  * Include volinfo in openafs-fileserver.
  * Document FAM's lack of support for AFS's security model and recommend
    gamin instead.  (Closes: #343246)
  * Add a hint to README.Debian on what to do about the cache partition if
    running ReiserFS or XFS without a spare partition.
  * Use make install into debian/tmp rather than make dest.  make dest is
    mostly for Transarc compatibility and make install looks more like a
    typical package and makes it easier to evaluate differences in FHS
    location between upstream and Debian.  As a side effect, there's no
    need to mess with the @sys link.  (Closes: #165909)
  * Install more files with dh_install rather than install commands in
    debian/rules so that *.install shows a more complete picture of what
    goes into each package.
  * Don't ignore make distclean errors.

    - openafs-dbserver: Install prdb_check and vldb_check.
    - openafs-fileserver: Install voldump.
    - openafs-client: Install fstrace, scout, and up (as afs-up).
    - Modify fstrace to load its catalog from /usr/share/openafs.
  * Do not install kpwvalid.  The default version does little useful and
    the kpwvalid binary must be in AFS for it to take effect.
  * Overhaul the way kernel modules are built.
    - Recommend linux-image rather than kernel-image for newer kernels.
    - Always recommend the kernel package; since it's only a recommends,
      there's no need to special-case the hand-built kernel case.
    - Be less fragile about how the kernel version is used in prep-modules
      to support other ways kernel modules are built.  (Closes: #341836)
    - Add Build-Depends and Uploaders to the openafs-modules-source
      control file.
    - Remove unused parts of prep-modules and heavily comment it.
  * openafs-client should only recommend the AFS kernel module.  Many of
    the client programs will work in unauthenticated mode without it, and
    openafs-fileserver depends on it (but doesn't require the kernel
    module).  (Closes: #342095)
  * openafs-modules-source no longer has to depend on as many libraries.
  * Suggest the same PAM settings for pam_krb5 that libpam-krb5 does.

openafs (1.4rc4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Correctly handle root.afs becoming replicated after the client
      starts.  This should resolve the problems with AFS eventually
      failing on the first system using a new cell.  (Closes: #88906)
  * When kill_all_afs is enabled in /etc/openafs/afs.conf, only kill AFS
    processes if the runlevel is 0 or 6.  You really only want this when
    the system is shutting down.  (Closes: #325347)
  * Remove the init script check of the cache file system and instead
    improve the check in afsd.  The init script check used stat, which is
    in /usr/bin and therefore not fair game for init scripts.
  * Set PATH in the init script, just in case.
  * libpam-openafs-kaserver must depend on openafs-client, not just
    recommend it, since acquiring tokens requires that the client be
    running.
  * Expand README.Debian and include information about PAM configuration.
  * Link libpam-openafs-kaserver's doc directory to openafs-client.

  * New upstream version.
  * Install pam_afs.krb.so on hppa.  I believe the new PAM module build
    process fixes the issue that was being worked around before.
  * Improve the documentation and scripts for setting up new servers or a
    new cell.  afs-rootvol can now be run from a client configured to use
    dynroot.  afs-newcell generates the server CellServDB directly to work
    around oddities with bos addhost.  There are many other, more minor
    improvements as well.  Thanks to Faheem Mitha and Sergio Gelato for
    analysis and patches.  (Closes: #322638)
  * Update the configuration transcript to reflect the current packages,
    messages, and instructions.  Thanks, Faheem Mitha.
  * Fill in the server CellServDB with information about the local cell,
    if available in the client CellServDB, rather than always initializing
    it to contain just the name of the cell.
  * Detect AFS caches on non-ext2/ext3 file systems and abort AFS client
    initialization.  (Closes: #249315)
  * Provide a way of setting sysname in afs.conf.  (Closes: #324694)
  * Don't create the unused /etc/openafs/AFSLog file.  (Closes: #120097)
  * Redo how library object files are found for the PAM module build to
    avoid assuming C locale character set behavior.  (Closes: #323582)
  * Remove the openafs-client warning against dynroot for the first system
    in a cell now that afs-rootvol can cope.  Provide some basic
    documentation of the CellAlias syntax in that message until we have a
    real man page.
  * Suggest openafs-doc.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 for the kernel module packages (no
    changes required).

  * Add support for ppc64, thanks Andreas Jochens.  (Closes: #322020)
  * Improve the openafs-client init script.
    - Update the default client options based on the cache tuning synopsis
      by Jeffrey Hutzelman, including setting a larger chunksize for all
      default option sets.  (Closes: #303944)
    - Choose the client options based on the cache size by default.
    - Move the code to build the options string to the init script from
      afs.conf so that afs.conf is pure configuration.
    - Add an AFS_PRE_SHUTDOWN hook called before shutting down the client.
    - Provide a shutdown hook, disabled by default, that kills all
      processes with files open in /afs.  Enabling this ensures a more
      reliable clean shutdown and umounting of the cache partition, but
      may not always be what the admin wants.
    - Improve the readability of the output on start.
    - Significantly improve the comments in afs.conf.
    - Remove the code to set -nosettime as it's now the default.
  * Move the openafs-client init script and afs.conf file we use into the
    debian directory rather than patching the upstream version.  We've
    diverged so much that there's no point in continuing to merge changes.
  * Diagnose unsupported architectures earlier and with a clearer error.
  * Suppress error messages from a missing kernel version header since
    they occur normally when doing the regular package build and are just
    confusing.  Instead, print an error in kern-sysname and abort if the
    kernel version could not be determined.
  * Rework how PAM modules are handled.
    - Build against the pthread-aware libraries.  (Closes: #297804)
    - Use the shared library objects instead of building separate PIC
      objects, eliminating the need for many Makefile modifications.
    - Include pam_afs.krb.so as well.  (Closes: #165972)
  * Don't include the empty /usr/src/modules directory in
    openafs-modules-source, only the tarball, to match how other kernel
    module source packages behave.  (Closes: #244685)
  * Update config.guess and config.sub.
  * Translation updates.
    - French, thanks Christian Perrier.  (Closes: #318807)
    - Vietnamese, thanks Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #319705)

  * Output error messages from heredocs in the init script with cat rather
    than echo.  Thanks, Reid Barton.  (Closes: #311729)
  * Make bosserver less picky about permissions and remove the attempt to
    set /etc/openafs/server-local not-world-readable since dh_fixperms was
    overridding it anyway.  (Closes: #312921)
  * Fix some spacing and capitalization errors in the debconf templates.
    Thanks, Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #316597)
  * Initial Czech translation, thanks Martin Sin.  (Closes: #310699)

openafs (1.3.82-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  (Closes: #307699)
    - Proper locking for preempt kernels.  This bug manifested as an
      inability to shut down AFS cleanly.  (Closes: #308399, #304040)
    - Correctly handle the inotify semaphore.  (Closes: #303495)
  * Repackage upstream to remove MacOS-specific files covered by the APSL.
    Remove the WINNT directory to save space since we have to repackage
    anyway.  Provide a get-orig-source target to do the repackaging.
  * libpam-openafs-kaserver: Fix compilation so that the PAM module isn't
    missing symbols and therefore unusable.  (Closes: #308844)
  * Apply patch from Chas Williams to fix stale cache data from deleted
    files, a bug introduced in 1.3.82.
  * In all cases, only build the module appropriate to the kernel we're
    building against.  Building an SMP module against a non-SMP kernel
    fails due to missing defines.  (Closes: #225907)
  * README.modules: Add documentation for module-assistant and recommend
    it when using Debian kernels.  Mention divergences from upstream in
    module naming.  (Closes: #253168)  Emphasize that the kernel source
    tree used for make-kpkg must be identically configured to the kernel
    the module will be used with.
  * Update copyright with more complete information from upstream
    src/LICENSE.
  * Simplify clean target.  Upstream make distclean is now better.

openafs (1.3.81-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle modules named either with or without the .mp extension on SMP
    hosts.  (Closes: #305389, #307280, #307797)
  * README.Debian: Document that the client cache partition must be ext2
    or ext3 and that XFS and ReiserFS will not work.  upserver and
    upclient are now provided.  Provide some information about why
    kaserver is not provided.  (Closes: #249315)
  * Overhaul the module build rules.
    - Use debhelper to build the module binary package.
    - Let debhelper handle the module postinst and prerm control scripts.
    - Properly support modules_config and modules_clean.
    - Break the build process into configure, build, install, and binary
      rules, paralleling the regular build rules and making it easier to
      maintain the make-kpkg build targets.
    - Include the kernel version in the long description.
    - Update standards version of module packages to 3.6.1.
    - Include the copyright and basic documentation in the module binary
      package.  Otherwise, policy requires an exact versioned dependency
      on the package containing the copyright file.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.1.
    - Install Debian::OpenAFS::ConfigUtils in /usr/share, not /usr/lib.
    - Always enable debugging symbols and disable optimization if noopt is
      set in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  (Alas, this doesn't entirely work; the
      upstream makefiles don't always honor the configure options.)
    - /etc/init.d/openafs-fileserver restart starts bosserver if it's not
      already running.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V4.
    - Remove all *.conffiles control files.  They're no longer needed.
    - Use misc:Depends to get debconf dependencies.
    - Use dh_install rather than the movefiles script.
  * openafs-dbserver doesn't need to depend on debconf.
  * Use dh_perl to get the correct Perl dependency for openafs-dbserver.
  * Remove unnecessary build dependencies.
  * Depend on comerr-dev rather than e2fslibs-dev.
  * Remove unnecessary preinst for openafs-fileserver.
  * Clean up and reformat package build rules.
  * Update lintian overrides.

    be preferred over DEB_DEST by the make-kpkg documentation.  Thanks,
    Jonas Smedegaard.  (Closes: #206403)

    resolve to 127.0.0.1.  (Closes: #163751)

openafs (1.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix PPC makefile so that it finds install; this time actually
    submitted upstream.

openafs (1.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops, that last upstream patch for rx debug and version didn't work on
    Linux.  Since some Debian users may run Linux, let's try again.

  * Swallow before vomiting, for it is the Debconf way, closes: #106030
  * Fix setting of INSTALL macro on powerpc, closes: #106019

    about in DNS.
  * Include upstream patch to prevent potential DOS with two RX servers
    looping rxdebug and version amongst each other.
  * Install rxdebug (oops)
  * Fix lintian overrides to get Lintian to stop complaining about

  *  New upstream snapshot
  * Fix module package to not have build cruft
  * Use --disable-kernel-module option except for module sources
  * Attempt to build modules correctly, although still not in right place
  * Pretend we build for alpha. This is mostly not a fiction, although I
    don't really know that much more than the kernel module and afsd
    work.  The pointer cast warnings are frightening.

openafs (1.0.90.20010704.snapshot-1) experimental; urgency=low

openafs (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, closes: #92776
  * Allow openafs-client to depend on openafs-modules-source not just
    openafs-modules.  This allows us to be installable on testing even

    kernel image mess.
  *  implement target for modules_clean, closes: #95049

    actually solve that problem apparently.

openafs (1.0.snap20001106-8) unstable; urgency=low

    This works better for AFS, even though it is not the way packages like
    alsa-base work.
  * Fix several typos in configuration scripts.

    records will be a while in the future.

    works  under fakeroot.  Important for modules package.

openafs (1.0.snap20001106-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Increase stacksize for server processes so they don't dump core.
  * New script: afs-rootvol--creates the root.afs and root.cell.  Works
    fairly well except that it is overly verbose and that it has my test
    cell hardcoded.  This script will evolve into part of a new cell
    config tool.

  * Support removing module for smP
  * Prune build directories out of modules sources--oops
  * Fix bogus depends for module sources--note that it really does want
    bison and flex at least for now.
