# Prepares to build kernel modules.  This script figures out and munges
# version strings.  The goal is:
#
#  * Set the package name to openafs-modules-$(KVERS) where $(KVERS) is the
#    major kernel revision plus the debian subrevision and whatever
#    architecture string is appropriate if building against the stock Debian
#    kernels.  $(KVERS) should be identical to the version component contained
#    in the Debian kernel package names (in other words, the ABI version, not
#    the package version)..
#
#  * Make the package recommend linux-image-$(KVERS) as appropriate for the
#    kernel version that we're building against.  Use recommend rather than
#    depends since the user may have built their own kernel outside of the
#    Debian package infrastructure.
#
#  * Save the version number of the binary package in debian/VERSION for later
#    use by dh_gencontrol.  This will be the version number of the source
#    package followed by a + and the version number of the kernel package that
#    we're building against.  If the kernel package version contains an epoch,
#    try to hack our way into doing the right thing by using that epoch number
#    as our own.  This isn't quite the right thing, but seems reasonably good.
#
# This script generates debian/control from debian/control.module using sed.
# Unfortunately, substvars cannot be used since the name of the package is
# modified and substvars happens too late.  It also outputs debian/VERSION,
# containing the version of the binary package.

# We can get the kernel version from one of three places.  If KVERS and KDREV
# are both already set in the environment (which will be the case when invoked
# by make-kpkg or module-assistant), use them.  Otherwise, if we have a kernel
# source directory that contains debian/changelog (generated by make-kpkg),
# parse that file to find the version information.  Finally, if neither works,
# extract the kernel version from the kernel headers, append INT_SUBARCH to
# that version if it's available, and assume a kernel package revision of -0
# if none is provided.
#
# Set the variables $afs_kvers, which will hold the revision of the kernel,
# and $afs_kdrev, which will hold the version of the kernel package that we're
# building against.
