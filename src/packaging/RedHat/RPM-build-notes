Beginning with the 1.4.5 release, OpenAFS's prebuilt binaries use a new
mechanism for packaging kernel modules on Fedora Core (all versions)
and RHEL 5 (and derivatives). This new mechanism allows the
installation of modules for multiple kernel variants simultaneously,
and is identical to the technique used by Fedora and Red Hat's own
out of tree kernel modules.

The difference is that instead of a single 'openafs-kernel' module,
multiple kmod-openafs-<variant> RPMs are produced. When manually
upgrading to OpenAFS 1.4.5, it may be necessary to remove any openafs-
kernel modules left behind by your old installation, and to ensure
that the appropriate kmod-openafs module is installed.

If you wish to build 'kmod' modules for new kernel release, this may
be done by rebuilding the SRPM  with 'fedorakmod' defined, and the
'kvariants' parameter set to the list of kernel variants you wish to
build modules for (a kernel-devel package must be installed for each
of these variants). Note that supplying '' as a variant will build
for a normal kernel. The 'kernvers' variable can be set to specify 
what kernel release version you wish to build for.

For example:
       rpmbuild -bb --define "fedorakmod 1" \
            --target i686 \
            --define "build_modules 1" \
            --define "kvariants '' PAE"  \
            openafs.spec

would build a kernel module for the normal and PAE variants of the
currently running kernel.

Old-style packages may still be built in the same way as previous
releases. However, note that you must use userland RPMs which match
the packaging of your kernel module. Old style kernel modules will
not work with a set of userland RPMs which expect kmod-style packages.
