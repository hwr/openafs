I=B9d be happy to relicense, however I=B9m unlikely to take the time to go
through the tarball changing all references to GPL to refer to a BSD-alike
license. Add to this the fact I do not have access to my CL account any
more. However I=B9m happy for the OpenAFS project to take the tarball and do
anything you like to it. The question then is simply what degree of
assurance/provability do you require that we will not renege on this
agreement later. Perhaps this email will suffice? :-)

Hi,

I'm personally happy making it available under a different license.
However,
most of this work (and almost all the actual implementation) was by Keir
Fraser, so he'll need to OK it as well.

Keir, if its OK with you then can we replace the copy of lock-free-lib at
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/lock-free/src/lockfree-lib.tar.gz
with one under a BSD-derived license?

Thanks,

Tim
