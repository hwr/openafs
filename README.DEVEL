Notes on Coding Standards/Requirements for OpenAFS Source
---------------------------------------------------------

We have an official style.  Please use it.  If you have gnu indent 2.2.9 or
later you can reformat for this style with the following option:

-npro -nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -br -ce -cdw -brs -ncdb -cp1 -ncs -di2 -ndj -nfc1
-nfca -i4 -lp -npcs -nprs -psl -sc -nsob -ts8

Do not use $< for non-pattern rules in any cross-platform dir as it
requires a reasonable make that is not available on all systems.

Do not have build rules that build multiple targets. Make doesn't seem able
to handle this, and it interferes with -j builds. (In particular, build the
rxgen targets individually and not using the flags for building all the files
in one shot.)

Try to test builds using gmake -j # MAKE="gmake -j #", it seems like a good
way to find missing or order-dependent dependency rules. (Is there a better
way to do this?)

-- Prototyping and Style --
Prototypes for all source files in a given dir DDD should be placed
in the file DDD/DDD_prototypes.h. All externally used (either API
or used by other source files) routines and variables should be
prototyped in this file.

The prototypes should be a full prototype, with argument and return
types. (Should not generate a warning with gcc -Wstrict-prototypes.)

Format of the prototype files should look like:

	Standard Copyright Notice

	#ifndef AFS_SRC_DDD_PROTO_H
	#define AFS_SRC_DDD_PROTO_H

	/* filename.c */
	prototypes

	/* filename.c */
	prototypes

	#endif /* AFS_SRC_DDD_PROTO_H */

In most of the existing prototypes, the define is DDD_PROTOTYPES_H, which is
probably ok as well.

The declaration of the routines should be done in ANSI style. If at some
later date, it is determined that prototypes don't work on some platform
properly, we can use ansi2knr during the compile.

	rettype
	routine(argtype arg)
	{

	}

All routines should have a return type specified, void if nothing returned,
and should have (void) if no arguments are taken.

Header files should not contain macros or other definitions unless they
are used across multiple source files.

All routines should be declared static if they are not used outside that
source file.

Compiles on gcc-using machines should strive to handle using
-Wstrict-prototypes -Werror. (this may take a while)

Routines shall be defined in source prior to use if possible, and
prototyped in block at top of file if static.

API documentation in the code should be done using Qt-style Doxygen
comments.

If you make a routine or variable static, be sure and remove it from
the AIX .exp files.

Suggested compiler flags:
	gcc: -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
	Solaris Workshop CC: -fd -v
		(You might not want the -fd, it isn't really useful, just complains about the
		K&R style functions, but -v gives useful info.)


Dependencies required to build OpenAFS from source
--------------------------------------------------
The following packages are required to build all of the OpenAFS code
from source on various operating systems:

On Debian:
- autoconf, automake, bison, comerr-dev, cpio, flex, libkrb5-dev,
  libncurses5-dev, libpam0g-dev, libxml2-utils, perl, pkg-config;
- libfuse-dev (for the FUSE-based user-mode client);
- dblatex, docbook-xsl, doxygen, xsltproc (for documentation);
- debhelper, hardening-wrapper, dkms (to build the Debian packages)

On FreeBSD:
- autoconf, automake, libtool;
- fusefs-libs, pkgconf (for the FUSE-based user-mode client);
- perl, dblatex, docbook-xsl, libxslt, python, ruby, zip (for documentation)

In addition, FreeBSD systems require kernel sources and a configured kernel
build directory (see section "FreeBSD Notes" in the README file).
